# [Anti Backlash Nuts](Anti%20Backlash%20Nuts)

The 4 M3 holes are meant to intersect the bolts that tighten the brass nut. I used M3 nylon set screws as a type of thread locker. I have not tested this design enough to know if it is effective at keeping the bolt tight.

# [Motor & Bearing Mounts](Motor%20and%20Bearing%20Mounts)

The Y Axis Bearing and Motor mount designs are done but I haven't installed them so I don't feel comfortable putting them here. I will update this repo when I have installed them and tested them to my satisfaction.
